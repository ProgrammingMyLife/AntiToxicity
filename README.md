# AntiToxicity
A mod which aims on reducing toxicity between players

## How it works
All it does is simply force-close your chat box when any swear word (or commonly used words by players which aim to be toxic) is typed into it, and shows a text in the middle of the screen reproaching you and telling you to calm down.

## Commands:
* /antitoxicity toggle - Disables/Enables the mod (enabled by default)

## Downloads:
* [1.0 - First release](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/AntiToxicity/releases/download/v1.0/AntiToxicity-v1.0.jar)

## Installation
* Simply drag the **AutoToxicity-v1.0.jar** to your **.minecraft/mods** directory and it should be loaded into your game.
